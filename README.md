An app that fills in the missing blanks with Spotify actions. Basic actions such as duplicating your playlists, creating a copy of someone else's playlist in your Spotify, arranging playlists in certain orders, and more features are currently unsupported in a quick and easy way within the Spotify app, even the more powerful desktop app. We'll be impementing those features by using the Spotify API and creating a sort of wrapper along with a web interface.
